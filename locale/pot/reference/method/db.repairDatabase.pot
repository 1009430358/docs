msgid ":method:`db.repairDatabase()` provides a wrapper around the database command :dbcommand:`repairDatabase`, and has the same effect as the run-time option :option:`mongod --repair` option, limited to *only* the current database. See :dbcommand:`repairDatabase` for full documentation."

msgid "During normal operations, only use the :dbcommand:`repairDatabase` command and wrappers including :method:`db.repairDatabase()` in the :program:`mongo` shell and :option:`mongod --repair`, to compact database files and/or reclaim disk space. Be aware that these operations remove and do not save any corrupt data during the repair process."

msgid "If you are trying to repair a :term:`replica set` member, and you have access to an intact copy of your data (e.g. a recent backup or an intact member of the :term:`replica set`), you should restore from that intact copy, and **not** use :dbcommand:`repairDatabase`."
