msgid "Forces the :term:`primary` of the replica set to become a :term:`secondary`, triggering an :ref:`election for primary <replica-set-election-internals>`. The method steps down the primary for a specified number of seconds; during this period, the stepdown member is ineligible from becoming primary."

msgid "Before stepping down, :method:`rs.stepDown()` will attempt to terminate long running user operations that would block the primary from stepping down, such as an index build, a write operation or a map-reduce job."

# 4abe1e39161c462182316f13f0913b92
msgid "To avoid rollbacks, :method:`rs.stepDown()`, by default, only steps down the primary if an electable secondary is completely caught up with the primary. The command will wait up to either 10 seconds or the ``secondaryCatchUpPeriodSecs`` for a secondary to catch up."

msgid "Upon successful stepdown, :method:`rs.stepDown()` forces all clients currently connected to the database to disconnect. This helps ensure that the clients maintain an accurate view of the replica set."

# 6a01181b35b24045bea689edaa853eed
msgid "Because the disconnect includes the connection used to run the command, you cannot retrieve the return status of the command if the command completes successfully; i.e. you can only retrieve the return status of the command if it errors. When running the command in a script, the script should account for this behavior."
