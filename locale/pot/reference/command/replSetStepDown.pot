msgid "Forces the :term:`primary` of the replica set to become a :term:`secondary`, triggering an :ref:`election for primary <replica-set-election-internals>`.

msgid "To avoid rollbacks, :dbcommand:`replSetStepDown`, by default, only steps down the primary if an electable secondary is completely caught up with the primary. The command will wait up to the ``secondaryCatchUpPeriodSecs`` for a secondary to catch up."

msgid "Upon successful stepdown, :dbcommand:`replSetStepDown` forces all clients currently connected to the database to disconnect. This helps ensure that the clients maintain an accurate view of the replica set."

msgid "Because the disconnect includes the connection used to run the command, you cannot retrieve the return status of the command if the command completes successfully; i.e. you can only retrieve the return status of the command if it errors. When running the command in a script, the script should account for this behavior."
