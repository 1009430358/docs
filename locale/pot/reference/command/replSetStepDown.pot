msgid "Forces the :term:`primary` of the replica set to become a :term:`secondary`, triggering an :ref:`election for primary <replica-set-election-internals>`. The command steps down the primary for a specified number of seconds; during this period, the stepdown member is ineligible from becoming primary."

When running the command in a script, the script should account for this behavior."
