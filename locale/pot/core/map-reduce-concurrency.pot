msgid "The final write lock during post-processing makes the results appear atomically. However, output actions ``merge`` and ``reduce`` may take minutes to process. For the ``merge`` and ``reduce``, the ``nonAtomic`` flag is available, which releases the lock between writing each output document. See the :method:`db.collection.mapReduce()` reference for more information."
