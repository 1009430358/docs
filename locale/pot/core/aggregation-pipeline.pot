msgid "The MongoDB aggregation pipeline consists of :ref:`stages <aggregation-pipeline-operator-reference>`. Each stage transforms the documents as they pass through the pipeline. Pipeline stages do not need to produce one output document for every input document; e.g., some stages may generate new documents or filter out documents. Pipeline stages can appear multiple times in the pipeline."
