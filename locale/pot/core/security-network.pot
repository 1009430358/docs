For administrators of MongoDB, the following capabilities are important: limiting incoming traffic on a specific port to specific systems and limiting incoming traffic from untrusted hosts."

msgid "Virtual private networks, or VPNs, make it possible to link two networks over an encrypted and limited-access trusted network. Typically, MongoDB users who use VPNs use TLS/SSL rather than IPSEC VPNs for performance issues."

msgid "Depending on configuration and implementation, VPNs provide for certificate validation and a choice of encryption protocols, which requires a rigorous level of authentication and identification of all clients. Furthermore, because VPNs provide a secure tunnel, by using a VPN connection to control access to your MongoDB instance, you can prevent tampering and \"man-in-the-middle\" attacks."
