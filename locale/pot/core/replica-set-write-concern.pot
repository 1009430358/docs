For example, the following method includes a write concern that specifies that the method return only after the write propagates to the primary and at least one secondary or the method times out after 5 seconds."

msgid "You can include a timeout threshold for a write concern. This prevents write operations from blocking indefinitely if the write concern is unachievable. For example, if the write concern requires acknowledgement from 4 members of the replica set and the replica set has only available 3 members, the operation blocks until those members become available. See :ref:`wc-wtimeout`."
