msgid ":term:`Replica sets <replica set>` use elections to determine which set member will become :term:`primary`. Elections occur after initiating a replica set, and also any time the primary becomes unavailable. The primary is the only member in the set that can accept write operations. If a primary becomes unavailable, elections allow the set to recover normal operations without manual intervention. Elections are part of the :ref:`failover process <replica-set-failover-administration>`."

msgid "After a replica set has a stable primary, the election algorithm will make a \"best-effort\" attempt to have the secondary with the highest :rsconf:`~members[n].priority` available call an election. Member priority affects both the timing and the outcome of elections; secondaries with higher priority call elections relatively sooner than secondaries with lower priority, and are also more likely to win. However, a lower priority instance can be elected as primary for brief periods, even if a higher priority secondary is available. Replica set members continue to call elections until the highest priority member available becomes primary."
