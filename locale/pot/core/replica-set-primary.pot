MongoDB applies write operations on the :term:`primary` and then records the operations on the primary's :doc:`oplog </core/replica-set-oplog>`. :ref:`Secondary <replica-set-secondary-members>` members replicate this log and apply the operations to their data sets."

msgid "In some circumstances, two nodes in a replica set may *transiently* believe that they are the primary, but at most, one of them will be able to complete writes with :ref:`{w: majority} write concern <wc-w>`. The node that can complete :ref:`{w: majority} <wc-w>` writes is the current primary, and the other node is a former primary that has not yet recognized its demotion, typically due to a :term:`network partition`. When this occurs, clients that connect to the former primary may observe stale data despite having requested read preference :readmode:`primary`."
