msgid "For sharded collections in a :term:`sharded cluster`, the :program:`mongos` directs write operations from applications to the shards that are responsible for the specific *portion* of the data set. The :program:`mongos` uses the cluster metadata from the :ref:`config database <sharding-config-server>` to route the write operation to the appropriate shards."

msgid "MongoDB partitions data in a sharded collection into *ranges* based on the values of the :term:`shard key`. Then, MongoDB distributes these chunks to shards. The shard key determines the distribution of chunks to shards. This can affect the performance of write operations in the cluster."

msgid "Update operations that affect a *single* document **must** include the :term:`shard key` or the ``_id`` field. Updates that affect multiple documents are more efficient in some situations if they have the :term:`shard key`, but can be broadcast to all shards."

msgid "In :term:`replica sets <replica set>`, all write operations go to the set's :term:`primary`. The primary applies the write operation and records the operations on the primary's operation log or :term:`oplog`. The oplog is a reproducible sequence of operations to the data set. :term:`Secondary` members of the set continuously replicate the oplog and apply the operations to themselves in an asynchronous process."
