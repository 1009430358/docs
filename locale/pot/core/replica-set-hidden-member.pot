msgid "A hidden member maintains a copy of the :term:`primary's <primary>` data set but is **invisible** to client applications. Hidden members are good for workloads with different usage patterns from the other members in the :term:`replica set`. Hidden members must always be :ref:`priority 0 members <replica-set-secondary-only-members>` and so **cannot become primary**. The :method:`db.isMaster()` method does not display hidden members. Hidden members, however, **may vote** in :ref:`elections <replica-set-elections>`."
