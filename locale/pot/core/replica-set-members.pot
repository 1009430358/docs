msgid "In :ref:`some circumstances <edge-cases>`, two nodes in a replica set may *transiently* believe that they are the primary, but at most, one of them will be able to complete writes with :writeconcern:`{ w: \"majority\" } <\"majority\">` write concern. The node that can complete :writeconcern:`{ w: \"majority\" } <\"majority\">` writes is the current primary, and the other node is a former primary that has not yet recognized its demotion, typically due to a :term:`network partition`. When this occurs, clients that connect to the former primary may observe stale data despite having requested read preference :readmode:`primary`, and new writes to the former primary will eventually roll back."
