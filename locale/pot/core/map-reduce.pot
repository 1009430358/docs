msgid "In this map-reduce operation, MongoDB applies the *map* phase to each input document (i.e. the documents in the collection that match the query condition). The map function emits key-value pairs. For those keys that have multiple values, MongoDB applies the *reduce* phase, which collects and condenses the aggregated data. MongoDB then stores the results in a collection. Optionally, the output of the reduce function may pass through a *finalize* function to further condense or process the results of the aggregation."

msgid "All map-reduce functions in MongoDB are JavaScript and run within the :program:`mongod` process. Map-reduce operations take the documents of a single :term:`collection` as the *input* and can perform any arbitrary sorting and limiting before beginning the map stage. :dbcommand:`mapReduce` can return the results of a map-reduce operation as a document, or may write the results to collections. The input and the output collections may be sharded."

msgid "In MongoDB, map-reduce operations use custom JavaScript functions to *map*, or associate, values to a key. If a key has multiple values mapped to it, the operation *reduces* the values for the key to a single object."

msgid "The use of custom JavaScript functions provide flexibility to map-reduce operations. For instance, when processing a document, the map function can create more than one key and value mapping or no mapping. Map-reduce operations can also use a custom JavaScript function to make final modifications to the results at the end of the map and reduce operation, such as perform additional calculations."

msgid "In MongoDB, the map-reduce operation can write results to a collection or return the results inline. If you write map-reduce output to a collection, you can perform subsequent map-reduce operations on the same input collection that merge replace, merge, or reduce new results with previous results. See :dbcommand:`mapReduce` and :doc:`/tutorial/perform-incremental-map-reduce` for details and examples."
