msgid "The WiredTiger storage engine is the default storage engine starting in MongoDB 3.2. For existing deployments, if you do not specify the ``--storageEngine`` or the :setting:`storage.engine` setting, MongoDB 3.2 can automatically determine the storage engine used to create the data files in the ``--dbpath`` or :setting:`storage.dbPath`. See :ref:`3.2-storage-engine-compatibility`."

# d1352860198f427a82528318f6bd1c3a
msgid "For most read and write operations, WiredTiger uses optimistic concurrency control. WiredTiger uses only intent locks at the global, database and collection levels. When the storage engine detects conflicts between two operations, one will incur a write conflict causing MongoDB to transparently retry that operation."
