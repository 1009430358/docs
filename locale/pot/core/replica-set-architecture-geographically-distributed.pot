msgid "While :term:`replica sets <replica set>` provide basic protection against single-instance failure, replica sets whose members are all located in a single data center are susceptible to data center failures. Power outages, network interruptions, and natural disasters are all issues that can affect replica sets whose members are located in a single facility."

If possible, use an odd number of data centers, and choose a distribution of members that maximizes the likelihood that even with a loss of a data center, the remaining replica set members can form a majority or at minimum, provide a copy of your data."
