As a result, in addition to upgrading MongoDB processes, if your deployment uses authentication and authorization, after upgrading all MongoDB process to 2.6 you **must** also upgrade the authorization model."

msgid "This allows 2.6 some time to \"burn in\" and decreases the likelihood of downgrades occurring after the user privilege model upgrade. The user authentication and access control will continue to work as it did in 2.4, **but** it will be impossible to create or modify users or to use user-defined roles until you run the authorization upgrade."
