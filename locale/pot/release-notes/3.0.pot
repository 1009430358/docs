This enhancement, along with the :parameter:`auditAuthorizationSuccess` parameter, enables auditing to filter on CRUD operations. However, enabling :parameter:`auditAuthorizationSuccess` to audit of all authorization successes degrades performance more than auditing only the authorization failures."
