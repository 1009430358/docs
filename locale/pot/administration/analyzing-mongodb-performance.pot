msgid "As you develop and operate applications with MongoDB, you may need to analyze the performance of the application and its database. When you encounter degraded performance, it is often a function of database access strategies, hardware availability, and the number of open database connections."

msgid "Performance issues may indicate that the database is operating at capacity and that it is time to add additional capacity to the database. In particular, the application's :term:`working set` should fit in the available physical memory. See :ref:`analyzing-memory-mmapv1` for more information on the working set."
