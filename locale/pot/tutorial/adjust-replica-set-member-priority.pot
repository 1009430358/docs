msgid "The ``priority`` settings of replica set members affect both the timing and the outcome of :doc:`elections </core/replica-set-elections>` for primary. Higher-priority members are more likely to call elections, and are more likely to win. Use this setting to ensure that some members are more likely to become primary and that others can never become primary."
