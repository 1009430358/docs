msgid "While :term:`replica sets <replica set>` provide basic protection against single-instance failure, replica sets whose members are all located in a single facility are susceptible to errors in that facility. Power outages, network interruptions, and natural disasters are all issues that can affect replica sets whose members are colocated. To protect against these classes of failures, deploy a replica set with one or more members in a geographically distinct facility or data center to provide redundancy."
