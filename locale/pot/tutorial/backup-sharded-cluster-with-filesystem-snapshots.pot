msgid "This document describes a procedure for taking a backup of all components of a sharded cluster. This procedure uses file system snapshots to capture a copy of the :program:`mongod` instance. An alternate procedure uses :program:`mongodump` to create binary database dumps when file-system snapshots are not available. See :doc:`/tutorial/backup-sharded-cluster-with-database-dumps` for the alternate procedure."
