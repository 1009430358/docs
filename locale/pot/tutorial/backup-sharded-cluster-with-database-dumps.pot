msgid "This document describes a procedure for taking a backup of all components of a sharded cluster. This procedure uses :program:`mongodump` to create dumps of the :program:`mongod` instance. An alternate procedure uses file system snapshots to capture the backup data, and may be more efficient in some situations if your system configuration allows file system backups. See :doc:`/administration/backup-sharded-clusters` for more information."
