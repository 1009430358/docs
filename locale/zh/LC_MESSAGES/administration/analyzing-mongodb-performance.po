"As you develop and operate applications with MongoDB, you may need to "
"analyze the performance of the application and its database. When you "
"encounter degraded performance, it is often a function of database access "
"strategies, hardware availability, and the number of open database "
"connections."

"Some users may experience performance limitations as a result of inadequate "

"Performance issues may indicate that the database is operating at capacity "

"With the MMAPv1 storage engine, page faults can occur as MongoDB reads from "

"Rapid increases in the MongoDB page fault counter may indicate that the "

msgstr ""

#: ../source/administration/analyzing-mongodb-performance.txt:115
msgid ""
"A single page fault completes quickly and is not problematic. However, in "
"aggregate, large volumes of page faults typically indicate that MongoDB is "
"reading too much data from disk."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/administration/analyzing-mongodb-performance.txt:119
msgid ""
"MongoDB can often \"yield\" read locks after a page fault, allowing other "
"database processes to read while :program:`mongod` loads the next page into "
"memory. Yielding the read lock following a page fault improves concurrency, "
"and also improves overall throughput in high volume systems."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/administration/analyzing-mongodb-performance.txt:124

"Increasing the amount of RAM accessible to MongoDB may help reduce the "
