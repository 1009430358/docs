"Specify a :operator:`$min` value to specify the *inclusive* lower bound for "

"Because :method:`~cursor.min()` requires an index on a field, and forces the"
" query to use this index, you may prefer the :query:`$gte` operator for the "
"query if possible. Consider the following example:"

"If you use :operator:`$max` with :operator:`$min` to specify a range, the "

msgid ""
"The :operator:`min` and :operator:`max` operators indicate that the system "
"should avoid normal query planning. Instead they construct an index scan "

":operator:`min` and :operator:`max`."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/includes/fact-query-min-max.rst:8
msgid ""
"If one of the two boundaries is not specified, the query plan will be an "
"index scan that is unbounded on one side. This may degrade performance "
"compared to a query containing neither operator, or one that uses both "
"operators to more tightly constrain the index scan."
