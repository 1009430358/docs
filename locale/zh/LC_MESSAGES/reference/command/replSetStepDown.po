"Forces the :term:`primary` of the replica set to become a :term:`secondary`,"
" triggering an :ref:`election for primary <replica-set-election-internals>`."
" The command steps down the primary for a specified number of seconds; "
"during this period, the stepdown member is ineligible from becoming primary."

msgid ""
"By default, the command only steps down the primary if an :data:`electable "
"<~replSetGetConfig.members[n].priority>` secondary is up-to-date with the "
"primary, waiting up to 10 seconds for a secondary to catch up."

msgstr ""

#: ../source/reference/command/replSetStepDown.txt:45
msgid ""
"Before stepping down, :dbcommand:`replSetStepDown` will attempt to terminate"
" long running user operations that would block the primary from stepping "
"down, such as an index build, a write operation or a map-reduce job."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/reference/command/replSetStepDown.txt:50
msgid ""
"To avoid rollbacks, :dbcommand:`replSetStepDown`, by default, only steps "
"down the primary if an electable secondary is completely caught up with the "
"primary. The command will wait up to the ``secondaryCatchUpPeriodSecs`` for "
"a secondary to catch up."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/reference/command/replSetStepDown.txt:55
msgid ""
"If no electable secondary meets this criterion by the waiting period, the "
"primary does not step down and the command errors. However, you can override"
" this behavior by including the ``force: true`` option."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/reference/command/replSetStepDown.txt:59
msgid ""
"Upon successful stepdown, :dbcommand:`replSetStepDown` forces all clients "
"currently connected to the database to disconnect. This helps ensure that "
"the clients maintain an accurate view of the replica set."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/reference/command/replSetStepDown.txt:63
msgid ""
"Because the disconnect includes the connection used to run the command, you "
"cannot retrieve the return status of the command if the command completes "
"successfully; i.e. you can only retrieve the return status of the command if"
" it errors. When running the command in a script, the script should account "
"for this behavior."
