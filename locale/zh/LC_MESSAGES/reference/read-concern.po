"MongoDB 3.2 introduces the ``readConcern`` query option for replica sets and"
" replica set shards. By default, MongoDB uses a read concern of "
"``\"local\"`` to return the most recent data available to the MongoDB "
"instance at the time of the query, even if the data has not been persisted "
"to a majority of replica set members and may be rolled back."
