"Aggregations operations process data records and return computed results. "
"Aggregation operations group values from multiple documents together, and "
"can perform a variety of operations on the grouped data to return a single "
"result. MongoDB provides three ways to perform aggregation: the "
":doc:`aggregation pipeline </core/aggregation-pipeline>`, the :doc:`map-"
"reduce function </core/map-reduce>`, and :doc:`single purpose aggregation "
"methods and commands </core/single-purpose-aggregation>`."

"聚合操作可以处理一组数据记录并返回计算后的结果。聚合操作将多个文档的值组合在一起，"
"并且可以对这组数据执行一系列操作后返回单个结果。Mongodb提供了三种方法来执行聚合："
":doc:`聚合管道 </core/aggregation-pipeline>`，:doc:`映射化简（map-reduce）方法 </core/map-reduce>`，"

"The aggregation pipeline is a framework for performing aggregation tasks, "

"MongoDB passes the documents of a single collection through a pipeline. The "
