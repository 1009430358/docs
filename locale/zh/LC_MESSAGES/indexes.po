"Indexes support the efficient execution of queries in MongoDB. Without "
"indexes, MongoDB must perform a *collection scan*, i.e. scan every document "
"in a collection, to select those documents that match the query statement. "
"If an appropriate index exists for a query, MongoDB can use the index to "
"limit the number of documents it must inspect."

"Indexes are special data structures [#b-tree]_ that store a small portion of"
" the collection's data set in an easy to traverse form. The index stores the"
" value of a specific field or set of fields, ordered by the value of the "
"field. The ordering of the index entries supports efficient equality matches"
" and range-based query operations. In addition, MongoDB can return sorted "
"results by using the ordering in the index."
