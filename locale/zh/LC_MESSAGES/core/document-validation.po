"MongoDB provides the capability to validate documents during updates and "
"insertions. Validation rules are specified on a per-collection basis using "
"the ``validator`` option, which takes a document that specifies the "
"validation rules or expressions. Specify the expressions using any "
":ref:`query operators <query-selectors>`, with the exception of "
":query:`$near`, :query:`$nearSphere`, :query:`$text`, and :query:`$where`."
