"This capability provides \"data center awareness,\" which allows applications "
"to target MongoDB deployments with consideration of the physical location of "
"the :program:`mongod` instances. MongoDB supports segmentation of operations "
"across different dimensions, which may include multiple data centers and "
"geographical regions in multi-data center deployments, racks, networks, or "
"power circuits in single data center deployments."

"MongoDB also supports segregation of database operations based on functional "
