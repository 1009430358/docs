"If encryption is enabled, the default encryption mode that MongoDB "

"Standard in Cipher Block Chaining mode) via OpenSSL. AES-256 uses a "
"symmetric key; i.e. the same key to encrypt and decrypt text. MongoDB "
"Enterprise also supports authenticated encryption ``AES256-GCM`` (or 256-bit"
" Advanced Encryption Standard in Galois/Counter Mode). FIPS mode encryption "
