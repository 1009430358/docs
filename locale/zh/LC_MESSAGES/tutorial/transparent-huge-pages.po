"Transparent Huge Pages (THP) is a Linux memory management system that "
"reduces the overhead of Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) lookups on "
"machines with large amounts of memory by using larger memory pages."

"However, database workloads often perform poorly with THP, because they tend"
" to have sparse rather than contiguous memory access patterns. You should "
"disable THP on Linux machines to ensure best performance with MongoDB."
