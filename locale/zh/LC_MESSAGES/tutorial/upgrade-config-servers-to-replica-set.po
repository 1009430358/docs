"Starting in MongoDB 3.2, config servers for sharded clusters can be deployed"
" as a :doc:`replica set </core/replication-introduction>`. Using a replica "
"set for the config servers improves consistency across the config servers, "
"since MongoDB can take advantage of the standard replica set read and write "
"protocols for the config data. In addition, using a replica set for config "
"servers allows a sharded cluster to have more than 3 config servers since a "
"replica set can have up to 50 members. To deploy config servers as a replica"
" set, the config servers must run the :doc:`WiredTiger storage engine "
"</core/wiredtiger>`."
