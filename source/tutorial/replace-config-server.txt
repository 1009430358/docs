Replace a Config Server

   For replacing config servers deployed as three mirrored
   :program:`mongod` instances, see
   :doc:`/tutorial/migrate-config-servers-with-same-hostname` and
   :doc:`/tutorial/migrate-config-servers-with-different-hostnames`.

Overview
--------

If the config server replica set becomes read only, i.e. does not
have a primary, the sharded cluster cannot support operations that change
the cluster metadata, such as chunk splits and migrations. Although no
chunks can be split or migrated, applications will be able to write data
to the sharded cluster.

If one of the config servers is unavailable or inoperable, repair or
replace it as soon as possible. The following procedure replaces a member
of a :ref:`config server replica set <sharding-config-server>` with a new
member.

The tutorial is specific to MongoDB |version|. For earlier versions of
MongoDB, refer to the corresponding version of the MongoDB Manual.
