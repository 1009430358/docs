In a production cluster, you must ensure that data is redundant and
that your systems are highly available. To that end, a production
cluster must have the following components:

- Config Servers
    .. versionchanged:: 3.2

       .. include:: /includes/fact-mirrored-config-servers-deprecated.rst

    A single :term:`sharded cluster` must have exclusive use of its
    :ref:`config servers <sharding-config-server>`. If you have multiple
    sharded clusters, each cluster must have its own replica set config
    servers.

- Two or More Replica Sets As Shards
    These replica sets are the :term:`shards <shard>`. For information
    on replica sets, see :doc:`/replication`.

- One or More Query Routers (``mongos``)
    The :program:`mongos` instances are the routers for the cluster.
    Typically, deployments have one :program:`mongos` instance on each
    application server.

    You may also deploy a group of :program:`mongos` instances and use
    a proxy/load balancer between the application and the
    :program:`mongos`. In these deployments, you *must* configure the
    load balancer for *client affinity* so that every connection from a
    single client reaches the same :program:`mongos`.

    Because cursors and other resources are specific to an single
    :program:`mongos` instance, each client must interact with only one
    :program:`mongos` instance.
