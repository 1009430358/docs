All sharded collections **must** have an index that starts with the
:term:`shard key`; i.e. the index can be an index on the shard key or a
:term:`compound index` where the shard key is a prefix of the index.
   
If you shard a collection without any documents and
*without* such an index, the :dbcommand:`shardCollection` command will
create the index on the shard key. If the collection already has
documents, you must create the index before using
:dbcommand:`shardCollection`.

.. important:: The index on the shard key **cannot** be a
   :ref:`multikey index <index-type-multikey>`.

Example
-------

A sharded collection named ``people`` has for its shard key the field
``zipcode``. It currently has the index ``{ zipcode: 1 }``. You can
replace this index with a compound index ``{ zipcode: 1, username: 1
}``, as follows:

#. Create an index on ``{ zipcode: 1, username: 1 }``:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.people.createIndex( { zipcode: 1, username: 1 } );

#. When MongoDB finishes building the index, you can safely drop the
   existing index on ``{ zipcode: 1 }``:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.people.dropIndex( { zipcode: 1 } );

Since the index on the shard key cannot be a multikey index, the index
``{ zipcode: 1, username: 1 }`` can only replace the index ``{ zipcode:
1 }`` if there are no array values for the ``username`` field.

If you drop the last valid index for the shard key, recover by
recreating an index on just the shard key.

For restrictions on shard key indexes, see :ref:`limits-shard-keys`.
