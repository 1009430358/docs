:term:`Sharded clusters <sharded cluster>` implement
:term:`sharding`. A sharded cluster consists of the following
components:

Shards
   A shard is a MongoDB instance that holds a subset of a collectionâ€™s
   data. Each shard is either a single :program:`mongod` instance or a
   :term:`replica set`. In production, all shards are replica
   sets. For more information see :doc:`/core/sharded-cluster-shards`.

Config Servers
   :ref:`Config servers <sharding-config-server>` hold metadata about
   the sharded cluster. The metadata maps :term:`chunks <chunk>` to
   shards.

   For more information, see :doc:`/core/sharded-cluster-config-servers`.

``mongos`` Instances
   :program:`mongos` instances route the reads
   and writes from applications to the shards.  Applications do not
   access the shards directly. For more information see
   :doc:`/core/sharded-cluster-query-router`.
