title: Shut down the entire cluster.
stepnum: 1
ref: shutdown-cluster
pre: |
  Stop all :program:`mongos` and :program:`mongod` processes, including
  all shards *and* all config servers. To stop all members, connect to
  **each** member and issue following operations:
action:
  language: javascript
  code: |
    use admin
    db.shutdownServer()

title: Restore the data files.
stepnum: 2
ref: restore
content: |
  On each server, extract the data files to the location where the
  :program:`mongod` instance will access them and restore the following:

  - **Data files for each server in each shard.**

    For each shard replica set, restore all the members of the replica
    set. See :doc:`/tutorial/restore-replica-set-from-backup`.

  - **Data files for each config server.**
 
    .. versionchanged:: 3.2

       If restoring to a :ref:`config server replica set (CSRS)
       <csrs>`, restore the members of the replica
       set. See :doc:`/tutorial/restore-replica-set-from-backup`.

    Else, if restoring to 3 mirrored config servers, restore the files
    on each config server :program:`mongod` instance as you would a
    standalone node.
