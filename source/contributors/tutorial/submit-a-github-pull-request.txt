Github 102: Submit a Pull Request
=================================

This tutorial outlines the steps to submit a pull request. You should
have a basic familiarity with the concepts discussed in
:ref:`github-101-setting-up-a-fork`.

Only submit a pull request after you have finished programming and
testing your proposed additions to the codebase.

Procedure
---------

Before you submit your changes, add yourself to the contributors list.
Most projects have a list of contributors in their GitHub README or
elsewhere in the repo.

Commit All Changes and Rebase
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/steps/commit-changes.rst
      
Squash Commits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have multiple commits, squash your commits into a single commit.

.. include:: /includes/steps/squash-commits.rst

Submit a Pull Request
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/steps/pull-request.rst

.. important:: 
   If you are submitting to the SERVER project (aka, mongo/mongodb),
   you **must** `sign and return the contributor agreement
   <http://www.mongodb.com/legal/contributor-agreement>`_ before your
   pull request can be added to the project.

The Life-Cycle of a Pull Request
--------------------------------

When you submit a pull request, here is what happens:

- The engineering team will review your pull request to make sure you
  have included a JIRA ticket in your request and signed the
  contributor agreement if applicable.

- You may receive a response from one of our engineers with additional
  questions about your contributions. If we cannot accept your pull
  request, you will receive an explanation of why we cannot accept your
  pull request.

- If your pull request matches a ticket and aligns with the project's
  roadmap, the appropriate team will triage and review your request.

- If approved, we will sign off and merge your request into a
  development branch and resolve the associated JIRA issue with an
  expected fixVersion.

Remember to show off your accomplishment by `requesting a contributor

landed.

Most importantly, thank you for your contributions.
