Github 101: Set Up a Fork
=========================

MongoDB projects are available on `GitHub <https://github.com>`_. For a
list of the MongoDB supported projects on GitHub, see
:doc:`/contributors/tutorial/choose-a-project`.

If you are not familiar with the git version control system, see
`<http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started>`_

To contribute to a MongoDB project, you should create a fork of the
project repository or repo. To fork a repository and set up a branch to
work on:

.. include:: /includes/steps/set-up-a-fork.rst

Now that you're set up with git, it's time to begin making your changes.
