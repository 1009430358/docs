The tutorials in this section enable access control. Once access control
is enabled, users must :doc:`authenticate </core/authentication>`
themselves. The following tutorials use the :ref:`default authentication
mechanism <authentication-mechanism-default>` .

.. important::

   Before enabling role based access control, you should first consider
   the users of the system. Once the users have been identified,
   determine the roles required by the users. Roles may inherit from
   other roles to provide a hierarchy.

   A user should have only the minimal set of privileges required to
   ensure a system of :term:`least privilege`.

   Each application and user of a MongoDB system should map to a distinct
   user in MongoDB; i.e. do not create a group user that
   is shared among multiple individuals. This *access isolation*
   facilitates access revocation and ongoing user maintenance.
